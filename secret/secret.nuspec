    <description>Secret is an easy-to-use multi-platform command-line encryption tool.

Secret makes use as easy as possible since it comes as a standalone binary file that doesn't require installation, all you need to do is copy the file to some path and run it directly from there.

Secret is capable of handling the encryption of even large files, and it supports all file types. Secret will also permit you to encrypt entire directories with ease, even recursively.</description>
