    <description>## Project Summary

AutomatedLab (AL) enables you to setup test and lab environments on Hyper-v or Azure with multiple products or just a single VM in a very short time. There are only two requirements you need to make sure: You need the DVD ISO images and a Hyper-V host or an Azure subscription.

### Requirements

Apart from the module itself your system needs to meet the following requirements:

- Windows Management Framework 5+ (Windows)
- .NET 4.7.1 (Windows PowerShell) or .NET Core 2.x (PowerShell 6+)
- Windows Server 2012 R2+/Windows 8.1+ (Hyper-V, Azure) or Linux (Azure)
- Recommended OS language is en-us
- Admin privileges are required
- ISO files for all operating systems and roles to be deployed
- Intel VT-x or AMD/V capable CPU
- A decent amount of RAM
- Low-Latency high-throughput storage (No spinning disks please, as there are issues related to them)

#### Windows

- Windows Management Framework 5+
- Windows Server 2012 R2+/Windows 8.1+
- Recommended OS language is en-us
- Admin privileges are required

#### Linux

- WSL supported, Azure Cloud Shell supported
- Tested on Fedora and Ubuntu, should run on any system capable of running PowerShell
- PowerShell 6+
- gss-ntlmssp to enable remoting (mandatory - no remoting, no way for AutomatedLab to do its thing)
- ip and route commands available
- Azure subscription - At the moment, AutomatedLab only works using Azure. KVM is planned for a later date.
